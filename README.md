# Vulnerability Scanner Tool

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of one-liners combining various security testing tools for performing vulnerability scans on specified targets. The included tools cover network scanning, web application testing, DNS enumeration, SSL/TLS analysis, and more. By automating these commands with GitHub Actions, users can efficiently conduct security assessments directly from their GitHub repository.

## Features

- Integration of multiple security testing tools into cohesive one-liners.
- Automates vulnerability scanning through GitHub Actions workflows.
- Supports customization for specific target IP addresses, URLs, and domains.
- Provides comprehensive security assessments including network, web application, and SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- `nmap`
- `w3af`
- `sqlmap`
- `dirb`
- `masscan`
- `whatweb`
- `burpsuite`
- `dnsrecon`
- `arp-scan`
- `unicornscan`
- `nikto`
- `fierce`
- `openvas`
- `zaproxy`
- `testssl.sh`
- `knockpy`
- `dnsenum`
- `sslscan`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner-tool.git
   cd vulnerability-scanner-tool
   ```

2. Customize the workflow file (`scan.yaml`) with your specific target IP addresses, URLs, and domains.

3. Commit the changes to your main branch:

   ```bash
   git add scan.yaml
   git commit -m "Customize scanning targets"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Usage

1. Ensure your GitHub repository is configured with GitHub Actions enabled.
2. Push changes to the main branch to trigger the vulnerability scanning workflow.
3. Monitor the workflow progress and review results in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.

### Example Commands

Here are some example commands from the `scan.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Command 1
nmap -sV -O -T4 <target_IP>
w3af -h <target_URL>
sqlmap -u <target_URL> --dbs
dirb <target_URL>
masscan -p 1-65535 <target_IP>

# Command 2
whatweb <target_URL>
burpsuite --scan <target_URL>
dnsrecon -d <target_domain>
arp-scan -I eth0 <target_IP>
unicornscan -H <target_IP>
```

Replace `<target_IP>`, `<target_URL>`, and `<target_domain>` with your actual targets.
